The pain was terrible, but there was no one home to give me any sympathy. I walked around the house, finally arriving at the telephone! Quickly, I called \u201cInformation Please\" and told her what happened.  She told me to open the icebox and hold a little piece of ice to my finger.\r\nAfter that, I called \"Information Please\" for everything. When my pet bird died, I told \"Information Please\" the sad story. She tried to comfort me, she said quietly, \"Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.\" Somehow I felt better. Another day I was on the telephone, \u201cHow do you spell \u2018grateful\u2019? \". All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was 9, we moved to Boston.\r\nA few years later, on my way to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes. Without thinking, I dialed my hometown operator and said, \"Information, please.\"    　　\r\nSurprisingly, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well, \"Information.\" I hadn\u2019t planned on this but I heard myself saying, \"Could you please tell me how to spell \u2018grateful\u2019?\"  \r\nThere was a long pause. Then came the soft-spoken answer, \"I guess your finger must have healed by now.\"   I laughed. \"So it\u2019s really still you,\" I said, \"I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time.\"  I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again. \"Please do,\" she said, \"Just ask for Sally.\"　　\r\nThree months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered me. I was told that Sally passed away five weeks before.   　　\r\nBefore I could hang up she told me that Sally left a message for me\u2014\u201cTell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in.

We tend to think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world's first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.\r\nB The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.\r\nC Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records began, we have only 'proxy records' reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere going back 600 years.\r\nD This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature. Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.\r\nE It is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod and herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic. A gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe stemmed from concerns over food supplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution involved intensive commercial farming and the growing of animal fodder on land not previously used for crops. The increased productivity from farmland made some countries self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection against famine.\r\nF Global temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, with the beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others, to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed, to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell before the newcomers, axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European fanning methods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly caused global warming. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as the use of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar. The rise has been even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given way to a new climatic regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the same time, extreme weather events like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more frequent.\r\n","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":0,"TextDescribe":"24342","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"29c472c3-f15a-4474-a576-45796638f59e","No":"C","Content":"4324","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"99795b8e-aa62-4b73-81ef-889467a43ace","No":"B","Content":"342","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"277b128a-da9b-4c00-b626-e6533af45eb5","No":"A","Content":"23","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"98878f1e-80b0-47d3-8a89-f5ebb0d2a184","No":"D","Content":"424","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false}]},{"UserOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Answer":""}],"QuestionCode":"faedb3d9-13d4-4239-9959-6144a01797f7","No":"一","Title":"<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"background-color: transparent;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;margin-left: 30px;white-space: normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700\">写出以下划线部分的句子成分<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"background-color: transparent;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;margin-left: 24px;white-space: normal\">1.<span style=\"font-size: 9px;font-stretch: 100%;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;line-height: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The pain was terrible, but there was no one home to give me any sympathy. I walked around the house, finally arriving at the telephone! Quickly, I called \u201cInformation Please\" and told her what happened.  She told me to open the icebox and hold a little piece of ice to my finger.\r\nAfter that, I called \"Information Please\" for everything. When my pet bird died, I told \"Information Please\" the sad story. She tried to comfort me, she said quietly, \"Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.\" Somehow I felt better. Another day I was on the telephone, \u201cHow do you spell \u2018grateful\u2019? \". All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was 9, we moved to Boston.\r\nA few years later, on my way to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes. Without thinking, I dialed my hometown operator and said, \"Information, please.\"    　　\r\nSurprisingly, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well, \"Information.\" I hadn\u2019t planned on this but I heard myself saying, \"Could you please tell me how to spell \u2018grateful\u2019?\"  \r\nThere was a long pause. Then came the soft-spoken answer, \"I guess your finger must have healed by now.\"   I laughed. \"So it\u2019s really still you,\" I said, \"I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time.\"  I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again. \"Please do,\" she said, \"Just ask for Sally.\"　　\r\nThree months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered me. I was told that Sally passed away five weeks before.   　　\r\nBefore I could hang up she told me that Sally left a message for me\u2014\u201cTell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in. He\u2019ll know what I mean.\u201d  I thanked her and hung up. I knew what Sally meant.\r\nNever underestimate the impression you may make on others.

We tend to think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world's first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.\r\nB The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.\r\nC Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records began, we have only 'proxy records' reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere going back 600 years.\r\nD This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature. Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.\r\nE It is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod and herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic. A gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe stemmed from concerns over food supplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution involved intensive commercial farming and the growing of animal fodder on land not previously used for crops. The increased productivity from farmland made some countries self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection against famine.\r\nF Global temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, with the beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others, to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed, to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell before the newcomers, axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European fanning methods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly caused global warming. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as the use of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar. The rise has been even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given way to a new climatic regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the same time, extreme weather events like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more frequent.\r\n","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":0,"TextDescribe":"22","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"34de8559-034e-47c0-9b11-076d7174297b","No":"B","Content":"23","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"29b28c64-473e-43ea-9c62-15596911c0bc","No":"A","Content":"32","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"0ba10425-634b-46d8-801a-382bb9cac298","No":"D","Content":"32","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"e75f2a81-a02a-4632-b463-ec150c267931","No":"C","Content":"23","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false}]},{"UserOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Answer":""}],"QuestionCode":"9a261ec5-e324-4748-a515-e20f251b0f67","No":"333","Title":"<p>33333<\/p>","TypeCode":1,"SubjectTitle":null,"SubjectContent":"A This book will provide a detailed examination of the Little Ice Age and other climatic shifts, but, before I embark on that, let me provide a historical context.

The text preceding this extract explained how subsidies can lead to activities which cause uneconomical and irreversible changes to the environment.]&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>All these activities may have damaging environmental impacts.&nbsp; For example, land clearing for agriculture is the largest single cause of deforestation; chemical fertilisers and pesticides may contaminate water supplies; more intensive farming and the abandonment of fallow periods tend to exacerbate soil erosion; and the spread of monoculture and use of highyielding varieties of crops have been accompanied by the disappearance of old varieties of food plants which might have provided some insurance against pests or diseases in future.&nbsp; Soil erosion threatens the productivity of land in both rich and poor countries.&nbsp; The United States, where the most careful measurements have been done, discovered in 1982 that about one-fifth of its farmland was losing topsoil at a rate likely to diminish the soil&#39;s productivity.&nbsp; The country subsequently embarked upon a program to convert 11 per cent of its cropped land to meadow or forest.&nbsp; Topsoil in India and China is vanishing much faster than in America.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Government policies have frequently compounded the environmental damage that farming can cause.&nbsp; In the rich countries, subsidies for growing crops and price supports for farm output drive up the price of land.&nbsp; The annual value of these subsidies is immense: about $250 billion, or more than all World Bank lending in the 1980s.&nbsp; To increase the output of crops per acre, a farmer&#39;s easiest option is to use more of the most readily available inputs: fertilisers and pesticides.&nbsp; Fertiliser use doubled in Denmark in the period 1960-1985 and increased in The Netherlands by 150 per cent.&nbsp; The quantity of pesticides applied has risen too: by 69 per cent in 1975-1984 in Denmark, for example, with a rise of 115 per cent in the frequency of application in the three years from 1981.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s some efforts were made to reduce farm subsidies.&nbsp; The most dramatic example was that of New Zealand, which scrapped most farm support in 1984.&nbsp; A study of the environmental effects, conducted in 1993, found that the end of fertiliser subsidies had been followed by a fall in fertiliser use (a fall compounded by the decline in world commodity prices, which cut farm incomes).&nbsp; The removal of subsidies also stopped land-clearing and over-stocking, which in the past had been the principal causes of erosion.&nbsp; Farms began to diversify.&nbsp; The one kind of subsidy whose removal appeared to have been bad for the environment was the subsidy to manage soil erosion.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>In less enlightened countries, and in the European Union, the trend has been to reduce rather than eliminate subsidies, and to introduce new payments to encourage farmers to treat their land in environmentally friendlier ways, or to leave it fallow.&nbsp; It may sound strange but such payments need to be higher than the existing incentives for farmers to grow food crops.&nbsp; Farmers, however, dislike being paid to do nothing.&nbsp; In several countries they have become interested in the possibility of using fuel produced from crop residues either as a replacement for petrol (as ethanol) or as fuel for power stations (as biomass).&nbsp; Such fuels produce far less carbon dioxide than coal or oil, and absorb carbon dioxide as they grow.&nbsp; They are therefore less likely to contribute to the greenhouse effect.&nbsp; But they are rarely competitive with fossil fuels unless subsidised - and growing them does no less environmental harm than other crops.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br/><\/p>","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":1,"TextDescribe":"哈哈","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"556038d1-3903-4a40-b3a6-1a28f0cfac06","No":"D","Content":"could be reduced by converting cultivated land to meadow or forest.

We tend to think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world's first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.\r\nB The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.\r\nC Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records began, we have only 'proxy records' reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere going back 600 years.\r\nD This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature. Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.\r\nE It is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod and herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic. A gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe stemmed from concerns over food supplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution involved intensive commercial farming and the growing of animal fodder on land not previously used for crops. The increased productivity from farmland made some countries self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection against famine.\r\nF Global temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, with the beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others, to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed, to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell before the newcomers, axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European fanning methods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly caused global warming. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as the use of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar. The rise has been even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given way to a new climatic regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the same time, extreme weather events like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more frequent.\r\n","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":0,"TextDescribe":"24342","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"29c472c3-f15a-4474-a576-45796638f59e","No":"C","Content":"4324","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"99795b8e-aa62-4b73-81ef-889467a43ace","No":"B","Content":"342","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"277b128a-da9b-4c00-b626-e6533af45eb5","No":"A","Content":"23","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"98878f1e-80b0-47d3-8a89-f5ebb0d2a184","No":"D","Content":"424","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false}]},{"UserOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Answer":""}],"QuestionCode":"faedb3d9-13d4-4239-9959-6144a01797f7","No":"一","Title":"<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"background-color: transparent;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;margin-left: 30px;white-space: normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700\">写出以下划线部分的句子成分<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"background-color: transparent;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;margin-left: 24px;white-space: normal\">1.<span style=\"font-size: 9px;font-stretch: 100%;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;line-height: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The pain was terrible, but there was no one home to give me any sympathy. I walked around the house, finally arriving at the telephone! Quickly, I called \u201cInformation Please\" and told her what happened.  She told me to open the icebox and hold a little piece of ice to my finger.\r\nAfter that, I called \"Information Please\" for everything. When my pet bird died, I told \"Information Please\" the sad story. She tried to comfort me, she said quietly, \"Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.\" Somehow I felt better. Another day I was on the telephone, \u201cHow do you spell \u2018grateful\u2019? \". All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was 9, we moved to Boston.\r\nA few years later, on my way to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes. Without thinking, I dialed my hometown operator and said, \"Information, please.\"    　　\r\nSurprisingly, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well, \"Information.\" I hadn\u2019t planned on this but I heard myself saying, \"Could you please tell me how to spell \u2018grateful\u2019?\"  \r\nThere was a long pause. Then came the soft-spoken answer, \"I guess your finger must have healed by now.\"   I laughed. \"So it\u2019s really still you,\" I said, \"I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time.\"  I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again. \"Please do,\" she said, \"Just ask for Sally.\"　　\r\nThree months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered me.

We tend to think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world's first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.\r\nB The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.\r\nC Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records began, we have only 'proxy records' reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere going back 600 years.\r\nD This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America.

We tend to think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world's first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.\r\nB The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.\r\nC Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records began, we have only 'proxy records' reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere going back 600 years.\r\nD This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature. Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.\r\nE It is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod and herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic.

Another day I was on the telephone, \u201cHow do you spell \u2018grateful\u2019? \". All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was 9, we moved to Boston.\r\nA few years later, on my way to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes. Without thinking, I dialed my hometown operator and said, \"Information, please.\"    　　\r\nSurprisingly, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well, \"Information.\" I hadn\u2019t planned on this but I heard myself saying, \"Could you please tell me how to spell \u2018grateful\u2019?\"  \r\nThere was a long pause. Then came the soft-spoken answer, \"I guess your finger must have healed by now.\"   I laughed. \"So it\u2019s really still you,\" I said, \"I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time.\"  I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again. \"Please do,\" she said, \"Just ask for Sally.\"　　\r\nThree months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered me. I was told that Sally passed away five weeks before.   　　\r\nBefore I could hang up she told me that Sally left a message for me\u2014\u201cTell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in. He\u2019ll know what I mean.\u201d  I thanked her and hung up. I knew what Sally meant.\r\nNever underestimate the impression you may make on others. Whose life have you touched today?\r\n","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":1,"TextDescribe":"细节题：从第二段的句子：可知information please给了作者信息和同情。选C","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"9dddaec1-cb1b-4236-981d-03be6afa57d9","No":"C","Content":"Sympathy and information.","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true}]},{"UserOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Answer":""}],"QuestionCode":"42df1792-201a-441c-a167-23198369809f","No":"标准选择题2","Title":"<p>By the mid-1980s, farmers in Denmark&nbsp;<\/p>","TypeCode":1,"SubjectTitle":null,"SubjectContent":null,"AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":0,"TextDescribe":"哈哈","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"d888d2ce-d9e3-44e2-a664-0f42d186efc3","No":"C","Content":"applied fertiliser much more frequently than in 1960.

We tend to think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world's first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.\r\nB The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.\r\nC Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records began, we have only 'proxy records' reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere going back 600 years.\r\nD This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature. Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.\r\nE It is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod and herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic. A gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe stemmed from concerns over food supplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution involved intensive commercial farming and the growing of animal fodder on land not previously used for crops. The increased productivity from farmland made some countries self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection against famine.\r\nF Global temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, with the beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others, to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed, to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell before the newcomers, axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European fanning methods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly caused global warming. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as the use of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar. The rise has been even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given way to a new climatic regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the same time, extreme weather events like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more frequent.\r\n","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":0,"TextDescribe":"24342","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"29c472c3-f15a-4474-a576-45796638f59e","No":"C","Content":"4324","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"99795b8e-aa62-4b73-81ef-889467a43ace","No":"B","Content":"342","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"277b128a-da9b-4c00-b626-e6533af45eb5","No":"A","Content":"23","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"98878f1e-80b0-47d3-8a89-f5ebb0d2a184","No":"D","Content":"424","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false}]},{"UserOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Answer":""}],"QuestionCode":"faedb3d9-13d4-4239-9959-6144a01797f7","No":"一","Title":"<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"background-color: transparent;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;margin-left: 30px;white-space: normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700\">写出以下划线部分的句子成分<\/span><\/p><p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"background-color: transparent;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;margin-left: 24px;white-space: normal\">1.<span style=\"font-size: 9px;font-stretch: 100%;font-variant-numeric: normal;font-variant-east-asian: normal;line-height: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

He moved to a small house in Cornish, New Hampshire, where he lived away from society until his death in 2010 at the age of 91.\r\nFor Salinger, fame and artistic honesty were not the same thing. Some people become writers because they wish their works to speak for themselves. Salinger appears to have been disgusted by the idea that he had become the spokesman for a generation. In death he has perhaps achieved his highest goal: to be out of the spotlight, represented only by his work.\r\n","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":0,"TextDescribe":"sfasfasf","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"43a0b6be-4f6b-4418-9d88-33dfe8cc1536","No":"D","Content":"s'd'fa'a'fa'fa'fa'fa","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"e2ba29c6-ca13-485e-b77d-97bb406d1d0f","No":"A","Content":"s'd'fa","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"a9382ff0-ccfc-4b44-8a81-99de6a819177","No":"C","Content":"s'd'fa'a'fa'fa'fa","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false},{"QuestionOptionCode":"5fef2535-745b-4ee2-8037-cb2d8fe13e74","No":"B","Content":"s'd'fa'a'fa","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false}]},{"UserOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Answer":""}],"QuestionCode":"ee4265d3-5878-4795-8e64-cb3e3129a77f","No":"12222","Title":"<p>2222<\/p>","TypeCode":1,"SubjectTitle":null,"SubjectContent":"A This book will provide a detailed examination of the Little Ice Age and other climatic shifts, but, before I embark on that, let me provide a historical context. We tend to think of climate - as opposed to weather - as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world's first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.\r\nB The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly 1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.\r\nC Reconstructing the climate changes of the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even more recent. For the time before records began, we have only 'proxy records' reconstructed largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the northern hemisphere going back 600 years.\r\nD This book is a narrative history of climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200. During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas, settled Greenland, and visited North America. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then, as always since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature. Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.\r\nE It is known that the Little Ice Age cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold decades of the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing towns and cities, where food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod and herring were already the staples of the European fish trade, but changes in water temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted to a colder and stormier Atlantic. A gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe stemmed from concerns over food supplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution involved intensive commercial farming and the growing of animal fodder on land not previously used for crops. The increased productivity from farmland made some countries self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection against famine.\r\nF Global temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, with the beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry farmers and others, to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed, to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Millions of hectares of forest and woodland fell before the newcomers, axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European fanning methods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly caused global warming. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as the use of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar. The rise has been even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given way to a new climatic regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the same time, extreme weather events like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more frequent.\r\n","AbilityItemCode":0,"QLevel":0,"TextDescribe":"22","AudioAccessoryCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","AudioPath":null,"QuestionOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"34de8559-034e-47c0-9b11-076d7174297b","No":"B","Content":"23","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"29b28c64-473e-43ea-9c62-15596911c0bc","No":"A","Content":"32","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"0ba10425-634b-46d8-801a-382bb9cac298","No":"D","Content":"32","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":true},{"QuestionOptionCode":"e75f2a81-a02a-4632-b463-ec150c267931","No":"C","Content":"23","Answer":null,"IsCorrect":false}]},{"UserOptions":[{"QuestionOptionCode":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Answer":""}],"QuestionCode":"9a261ec5-e324-4748-a515-e20f251b0f67","No":"333","Title":"<p>33333<\/p>","TypeCode":1,"SubjectTitle":null,"SubjectContent":"A This book will provide a detailed examination of the Little Ice Age and other climatic shifts, but, before I embark on that, let me provide a historical context.
